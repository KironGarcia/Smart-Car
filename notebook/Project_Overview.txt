====== Project Overview ======
Created Wednesday 03 September 2025

===== Project Description =====
This project consists of developing an IoT protection app, with an initial focus on autonomous cars. To demonstrate the app's effectiveness, we are building a mini autonomous car that simulates basic functions such as line recognition (path), obstacle detection with proximity sensors, and a system similar to a real car that can be hacked. The hacking will be simulated in real-time at a fair, using a CAN module based on the vulnerability explored in a Jeep Cherokee (command injection in the CAN bus). The app will block the attack, and an LCD will display messages like "Hacked" (in red) or "Attack blocked" according to the status. The car does not need to be 100% autonomous, but must show these basic functionalities.

===== Objective =====
Demonstrate the effectiveness of the IoT protection app by mitigating hacking attacks in a controlled environment, using a physical prototype of a mini autonomous car.
