====== Back to Work ======
Created Wednesday 03 September 2025

===== Problems Found =====
* USB connection to Raspberry Pi not working properly
* Had to add KironWifi as backup connection for comfortable work
* USB interface configured but Pi not responding on 192.168.7.2

===== Solutions Implemented =====
==== Added KironWifi Connection ====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
# Add KironWifi connection to Raspberry Pi
sudo nmcli con add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name "KironWifi" ssid "KironWifi"
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk "36900000"
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" ipv4.addresses "10.247.104.100/24"
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" ipv4.gateway "10.247.104.34"
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" ipv4.dns "10.247.104.34,8.8.8.8"
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" ipv4.method manual
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" connection.autoconnect yes
}}}

==== Connection Priority Setup ====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
# Set connection priorities
sudo nmcli con modify "KironWifi" connection.autoconnect-priority 100
sudo nmcli con modify "iotrac" connection.autoconnect-priority 50
sudo nmcli con modify "internet" connection.autoconnect-priority 30
}}}

===== Updated SSH Configuration =====
==== SSH Config File ====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
# Raspberry Pi KironWifi connection (FIRST PRIORITY)
Host raspi-kiron
    Hostname 10.247.104.100
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Raspberry Pi iotrac connection
Host raspi
    Hostname 192.168.0.2
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Raspberry Pi internet connection
Host raspi_internet
    Hostname 192.168.1.48
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Raspberry Pi USB connection
Host raspi_usb
    Hostname 192.168.7.2
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
}}}

==== Connection Priority Order ====
1. **KironWifi** (10.247.104.100) - With internet
2. **iotrac** (192.168.0.2) - No internet
3. **internet** (192.168.1.48) - Secondary WiFi
4. **usb** (192.168.7.2) - Direct connection

===== Raspberry Pi Shutdown Command =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
sudo shutdown -h now
}}}

===== Current Status =====
* KironWifi connection successfully configured
* SSH access working via raspi-kiron
* Ready to continue development work
* USB connection issue to be investigated later

===== New Problem Found =====
* GND connection issue: Multiple components need common ground reference
* Raspberry Pi has limited GND pins but needs to connect to L298N, LCD, Servo, Camera, and HC-SR04 sensor
* Components have separate power sources (Raspberry Pi with AA batteries, other components with powerbank)

===== Solution Implemented =====
* Connect single GND from Raspberry Pi to USB cable cut point
* All powerbank-powered components (L298N, LCD, Servo, Camera) share this common GND
* HC-SR04 sensor connects directly to Raspberry Pi GND (powered by AA batteries)
* Result: Only 2 GND connections from Raspberry Pi instead of multiple individual connections

===== GND Connection Diagram =====

===== Current Status =====
* Blinky code tested successfully
* GND connection strategy defined
* Ready to implement motor connections
